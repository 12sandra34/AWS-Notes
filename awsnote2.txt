Scope AWS services
==================

Region-scoped service:select the Region you want to use
If not asked to specify an individual AZ to deploy the service in:an indicator that the service operates on a Region-scope level 
For Region-scoped services:AWS automatically performs actions to increase data durability and availability.


To keep application available:maintain high availability and resiliency(Region-scoped managed services)


Interacting with AWS
====================

Every action you make in AWS is an API call that is authenticated and authorized

make API calls to services and resources through:
   
       -AWS Management Console
       -AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) 
       -AWS software development kits (SDKs)

AWS Management Console(web-based console):-
-----------------------------------------
the easiest way to create and manage resources when first begin working with the cloud

services are placed in categories such as: 
          
       -Compute 
       -Storage 
       -Database  
       -Analytics

AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI(unified tool )):-
-------------------------------------
open-source

Instead of manually logging in to the AWS Management Console to run a report to collect data from all the servers schedule an AWS CLI script with an API call to pull this data.
 
manage AWS services.
download and configure one tool that you can use to control multiple AWS services from the command line and automate them with scripts.

AWS SDKs:-
-----------
open-source
API calls to AWS can also be performed by running code with programming languages by AWS software development kits (SDKs).
programming languages, such as C++, Go, Java, JavaScript, .NET, Node.js, PHP, Python, and Ruby.
Developers commonly use AWS SDKs to integrate their application source code with AWS services.


Security and the AWS Shared Responsibility Model
=================================================

Infrastructure services(Compute services, such as Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) ) :
-----------------------
AWS:manages the infrastructure and foundation services
Customer:control the operating system and application platform,in addition to encrypting, protecting, and managing customer data

Container services(such as Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) ) :
---------------------
AWS:infrastructure and foundation services, operating system, and application platform
Customer:customer data, encrypting the data, and protecting it through network firewalls and backups

Abstracted services(such as Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3)) :
---------------------
AWS:operates the infrastructure layer, operating system, and platforms, in addition to server-side encryption and data protection
Customer:managing customer data and protecting it through client-side encryption


AWS root user
==============
when created aws account begin with single sign-in identity:access to all AWS services and resources in the account
the identity is AWS root user

AWS root user credentials:
---------------------------
2 sets of credentials

1.email address and password used to create the account(access the AWS Management Console)
2. access keys(make programmatic requests from the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) or AWS API)

Multi-factor authentication (MFA):
==================================

for preventing unwanted access

enable MFA on root user provide

    -email and password combination
    -temporary numeric code provided by an MFA device


AWS Identity and Access Management
===================================

manage access to your AWS account and resources
provides a centralized view of who and what are allowed inside your AWS account (authentication)
who and what have permissions to use and work with your AWS resources (authorization)
share access to an AWS account and resources without sharing your set of access keys or password


IAM User
---------
user represents a person or service that interacts with AWS
consists of a name and a set of credentials

IAM groups
----------
collection of users
All users in the group inherit the permissions assigned to the group.
possible to give permissions to multiple users at once

IAM Policies
-------------
To manage access and provide permissions to AWS services and resources, you create IAM policies and attach them to IAM users, groups, and roles
