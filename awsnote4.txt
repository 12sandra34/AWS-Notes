AWS with serverless compute:
    to deploy workloads and applications without having to manage any EC2 instances

serverless compute options:

AWS Lambda
===========
run code without provisioning or managing servers or containers.
upload your source code, and Lambda takes care of everything required to run and scale your code with high availability.

Lambda function has three primary components :
 
     -trigger
     -code 
     -configuration. 

AWS Fargate
============
purpose-built serverless compute engine for containers
scales and manages the infrastructure
achieves this by allocating the right amount of compute,eliminating the need to choose and handle EC2 instances and cluster capacity, and scaling
Fargate supports both Amazon ECS and Amazon EKS architecture, and provides workload isolation and improved security by design



NETWORKING
============

Amazon Virtual Private Cloud(VPC):
----------------------------------

An isolated network created in the AWS cloud 

Create a subnet:
------------------
After  creating VPC create subnets inside the network
provide high availability and connectivity options for your resources

Gateways
==========

Internet gateway:
-------------------
To enable internet connectivity for VPC-create an internet gateway(just like modem)
nternet gateway is highly available and scalable

Virtual private gateway:
------------------------
virtual private gateway connects AWS VPC to another private network.
after attaching the gateway acts as anchor on the AWS side of the connection
other side of the connection connect a customer gateway to the other private network
