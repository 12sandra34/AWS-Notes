Compute options in AWS:
-----------------------
   
   -virtual machines (VMs)
   -container services  
   -serverless

Virtual machines:to run virtual machines install a hypervisor on a host machine.The hypervisor provisions the resources to create and run your VMs.
  
VM in AWS:Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud(Amazon EC2)

EC2:web service that provides secure, resizable compute capacity in the cloud
    can provision virtual servers called EC2 instances
    
create and manage EC2 instances through:

         -AWS Management Console
         -AWS Command Line Interface (CLI)
         -AWS software development kits (SDKs)  
         -automation tools 
         -infrastructure orchestration services

Amazom Machine Image(AMI): provides information required to launch ec2 instances.


Container Services
==================

containers:can host variety of workkloads like
   
    -web applications
    -lift and shift migrations 
    -distributed applications 
    -streamlining of development, test, and production environments

 With containers, workloads can be carried from one place to another, such as from development to production or from on premises to the cloud

Docker helps customers create, package, deploy, and run containers

In AWS, containers run on EC2 instances

container orchestration services(to manage the containers):
 
 Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS)
 Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)

Amazon ECS
==========
end-to-end container orchestration service
helps to spin up new containers and manage them across a cluster of EC2 instances 

Amazon EKS
===========
portable, extensible, open source platform
for managing containerized workloads and services
